# Slekup's Dotfiles

These are the dotfiles for my Arch Linux environment. 

You are free to use any of my configurations, but I would not recommend running any of the scripts, as some of the configurations are tailored to me.

## Installation

Clone the repository into your home directory and run the following command:

```sh
./setup.sh
```
